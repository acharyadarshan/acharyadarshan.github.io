# Personal Blog

This repository hosts the code for my personal [blog](https://shahayush.com).

The website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) — a static site generator written in Ruby — and uses a theme for academic websites, forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)

See more info at https://academicpages.github.io/

## Blog Workflow

If you're interested in writing a blog post for the website, you need to:

- [Fork](https://github.com/ayushkumarshah/ayushkumarshah.github.io/fork) the repository
- Write a blog post using Markdown in the `_posts` directory usinf the title `YYYY-MM-DD-Title.md`
- Push the changes to a topic branch, like `an-example-article`, on *your* fork of the repository
- Make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) against the `master` branch
